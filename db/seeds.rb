Talking to CBS's Scott Pelley, he recalled his mother yearning for a single-family home like the ones down the block. 'Not having enough money was a cause of constant tension,' he said. 'And when you are five or six years of age and your parents are yelling at each other, it's, you knowâ€”you think back on it now, you knowâ€”it's traumatic and it's hard.'",

  description: "Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis as three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business and Ernie Hudson as the Ghostbusters' first recruit in New York City. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis co-star as a client and her neighbor. Aykroyd conceived the film as a project for himself and fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus John Belushi, with the 'Ghostmashers' travelling through time and space in the future with magic wands. He and Ramis dramatically rewrote the script following Belushi's death and after Reitman deemed Aykroyd's initial vision financially impractical. Ghostbusters was released in the United States on June 8, 1984. It received a positive response from critics and audiences and grossed $242 million in the United States and more than $295 million worldwide. It was nominated for two Oscars at the 57th Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Song (for the eponymous theme song), but lost to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Woman in Red respectively.",

Joey and Chandler do, however, have the bigger bathroom. That their windows are less substantial and the foyer doubles as a kitchen is not ideal.

Today, itâ€™s a boutique rental building with mint-finished interiors and all the authentic loft features one expects in SoHoâ€”exposed beams, large windows overlooking cobblestone streets, high ceilings (12 ft). The prices, however, are affordable by prime downtown New York standards for two reasons: 1) the building has no luxury amenities (no doorman, gym etc.) and 2) the location is closer to Canal Street than ideally preferred. These two features aside, you have some wonderful properties that include a four bedroom on the fourth floor which was recently rented out for just under $24,000 per month (approximately $80 per ft).",
